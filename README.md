This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Tune sales data to uncover patterns, customer behavior, product performance, and transaction outcomes. The analysis aims to provide insights that can support business decision-making, customer segmentation, and sales strategy optimization.
The dataset contains transactional sales records including: Customer category, Customer gender, Age group, Product category, State of transaction and Transaction outcome (Profit or Loss).
Insights and Findings:

Customer Category Distribution:
Low: 13,041
Medium: 12,926
High: 8,899
This shows that most customers fall into the Low and Medium categories, suggesting opportunities for customer value growth and upselling.

Customer gender distribution:
Female (F): 17,439
Male (M): 17,427
Customer gender distribution is almost perfectly balanced, with female customers having a slightly higher number of total transactions.

Age group analysis:
The highest number of customers falls within the 20–40 age group (Adults).
This indicates that adults are the primary drivers of sales and should be a major target for marketing and promotions.

Product category performance
Accessories: 22,534
Phones: 7,093
Clothing: 5,239
Accessories are the most purchased product category, significantly outperforming phones and clothing.
